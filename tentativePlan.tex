\label{sec:Tentative Plan}
	As we have achieved good performance for the sensor detection problem, now the part which is left in the matching layer is to train a network to which is able to match images when they are from  different images. Now I had started writing the code for the deep hashing method discussed in the previous section.Finally after the completion of this my main motive would be to find a suitable solution for indexing phase (how to arrange the clusters containing similar binary vectors) and finally training the network which can generate binary vectors. After the completion of all these phases I will try to make a single network pipeline which is backpropagable which can increase the performance of our network.
