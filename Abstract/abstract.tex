Voluminous biometric projects acquire data from multiple sensors. Like in UIDAI project of India various fingerprint sensors of different technology and model are used for data acquisition.  This heterogeneity within sensors give rise to: sensor inter-operability issues ,problems in regulating sequence of commands for law-enforcement. With such increase in data also increases storage overheads and time complexity as if to find a needle in a haystack.
Nowadays deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance in hashing, due to the impressive learning power. In this paper, firstly I had to develop a way to hash the biometric fingerprint images, to reduce time complexity to linear or sub-linear and also storage overheads, and later on I also had to look at the problem of sensor inter-operability. For the later part, I present FPSensorNet fingerprint sensor identification using Deep-Convolutional Neural Network(D-CNN). The proposed approach is computationally efficient and yields high accuracy.
