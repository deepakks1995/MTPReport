title = "From image to sensor: Comparative evaluation of multiple PRNU estimation schemes for identifying sensors from NIR iris images",
abstract = "The field of digital image forensics concerns itself with the task of validating the authenticity of an image or determining the device that produced the image. Device or sensor identification can be accomplished by estimating sensor-specific pixel artifacts, such as Photo Response Non Uniformity (PRNU), that leave an imprint in the resulting image. Research in this field has predominantly focused on images obtained using sensors operating in the visible spectrum. Iris recognition systems, on the other hand, utilize sensors operating in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of different PRNU estimation schemes in accurately deducing sensor information from NIR iris images. We also analyze the impact of a photometric transformation on the estimation process. Experiments involving 12 sensors and 9511 images convey that the Basic and Enhanced Sensor Pattern Noise (SPN) schemes outperform the Maximum Likelihood and Phase-based SPN methods. Experiments also convey the need to explore alternate methods for performing digital image forensics on NIR iris images.",

abstract = "Semantic hashing[1] seeks compact binary codes of data-points so that the Hamming distance between codewords correlates with semantic similarity. In this paper, we show that the problem of finding a best code for a given dataset is closely related to the problem of graph partitioning and can be shown to be NP hard. By relaxing the original problem, we obtain a spectral method whose solutions are simply a subset of thresholded eigen- vectors of the graph Laplacian. By utilizing recent results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions of manifolds, we show how to efficiently calculate the code of a novel data- point. Taken together, both learning the code and applying it to a novel point are extremely simple. Our experiments show that our codes outper- form the state-of-the art.",

We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},
